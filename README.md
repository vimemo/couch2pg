### Refactor motivation

Started just to understand the code and got carried away with the possibilities. Want to at least have a conversation about:

- jest vs chai/mocha/sinon
- promises vs async/await
- functions vs classes
- underscore vs ramda
- imperative vs declarative
- etc

### TODO

- integrate with travis
- seed data for integration test rather than using actual local db
- cli/env

### Development Setup

```
yarn
```

### Running Tests

```
yarn test
```

### Code coverage

```
file:///<your-dir>/couch2pg/coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

### Notes

- jest: snapshot testing, mocking support, performant
