### Refactor motivation

Started just to understand the code and got carried away with the possibilities. Want to at least have a conversation about:

- jest vs chai/mocha/sinon
- promises vs async/await
- functions vs classes
- underscore vs ramda
- imperative vs declarative
- etc

### TODO

- linting
- unit test with jest mocks
- seed data for integration test rather than using actual local db
- cli/env


### Test

```
npm t
```
